# Heuristic for Classifying DNA Strands

Abstract

Biological molecules, especially proteins, are closely correlated at the structural and functional level [1], making them useful for analyzing the relationship between molecular properties. They contain various integral features that define their overall structure and function (ex. binding sites, active sites, and centers of interconnected DNA molecules). Measurements between such features and predetermined reference points can yield an effective protein classification mechanisms for computational purposes. Here, we propose a novel method for the classification of human DNA Ligase based on the geometric and structural analysis of key molecular features. All types of DNA Ligase share similarities in their amino acid sequences, with differences being attributed to slight variations in 3D structural characteristics. Our use of and work here on DNA Ligase serves as a proof of concept in order to demonstrate the applicability of relative geometry classification. Automation of this process allows for a better understanding of protein structure and functions, playing an essential role in analyzing biological cells in areas such as personalized medicine, crop technologies, and therapeutic interventions.
